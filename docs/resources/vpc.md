# kakaocloud_vpc (Resource)

The `kakaocloud_vpc` resource allows you to create and manage Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in KakaoCloud.  
A VPC defines an isolated network environment with its own IPv4 CIDR block, subnets, route tables, and internet gateway (IGW).  
You can specify the CIDR block and name, attach subnets, and manage lifecycle operations such as creation and deletion.  
This resource also provides metadata about default route tables, DNS support, and provisioning status.
