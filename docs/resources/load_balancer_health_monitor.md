# kakaocloud_load_balancer_health_monitor (Resource)

The `kakaocloud_load_balancer_health_monitor` resource allows you to configure and manage health checks for load
balancer target groups in KakaoCloud.  
You can define check intervals, response timeouts, retry conditions, and HTTP-specific settings to ensure targets are
monitored accurately.  
This resource provides operational visibility and helps maintain high availability by automatically detecting unhealthy
targets.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# kakaocloud_load_balancer_health_monitor Terraform Resource Example

# Basic Usage (kakaocloud_load_balancer_health_monitor)
resource "kakaocloud_load_balancer_health_monitor" "example" {
  name             = "example-health-monitor"
  type             = "PING"
  delay            = 10
  timeout          = 5
  max_retries      = 2
  max_retries_down = 3
  target_group_id  = kakaocloud_load_balancer_target_group.example.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

- `delay` (Required, Number) Health check interval (seconds)

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

- `create` (Optional, String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
  consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (
  minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (Optional, String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
  consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (
  minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state
  before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (Optional, String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
  consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (
  minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (Optional, String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
  consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (
  minutes), "h" (hours).

### Nested Schema for `target_groups`

- `id` (String) Target group ID

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for
example:

```shell
$ terraform import kakaocloud_load_balancer_health_monitor.example <resource_id>
```
