<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `cluster_name` (String) Target cluster name
- `node_names` (Set of String) List of node names to remove

### Optional

- `is_cordon` (Boolean) Whether to set nodes to cordon state <br/>- `true`: Set the nodes to cordon state to block scheduling of new pods <br/>- `false`: Do not set the nodes to cordon state (default)
- `is_remove` (Boolean) Whether to delete or recreate nodes <br/> - `true`: Delete the nodes from the cluster <br/> - `false`: Recreate the nodes (drain nodes, create new ones, then delete the old ones)
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique ID of the node

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
