# kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_scheduled_scaling (Resource)

The `kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_scheduled_scaling` resource allows you to configure scheduled autoscaling rules for
node pools in a KakaoCloud Kubernetes Engine cluster.  
You can define scaling targets, schedules, and execution times to optimize resource usage and cost efficiency.  
This resource also provides status tracking and execution history for better visibility and operational control.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_scheduled_scaling Terraform Resource Example

# Basic Usage (kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_scheduled_scaling)
resource "kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_scheduled_scaling" "example" {
  name           = "example-scheduled-scaling"
  cluster_name   = kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_cluster.example.name
  node_pool_name = kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_node_pool.example.name
  desired_nodes  = 2
  schedule_type  = "once"
  start_time     = "2025-11-15T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Argument Reference

- `cluster_name` (Required, String) Target cluster name
- `desired_nodes` (Required, Number) Target number of nodes to maintain in the node pool when the schedule is executed
- `name` (Required, String) Scheduled autoscaling rule name
- `node_pool_name` (Required, String) Target node pool name
- `schedule_type` (Required, String) Scheduled scaling repeat settings<br/>- `cron`: runs periodically based on a CRON
  expression<br/>- `once`: runs only once at the specified start time
- `start_time` (Required, String) Reference time when scheduled autoscaling can actually run (ISO 8601, UTC)

- `schedule` (Optional, String) Scheduled autoscaling execution cycle
- `timeouts` (Optional, Attributes) Custom timeout settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

## Attribute Reference

- `created_at` (String) Resource creation time <br/> - ISO_8601 format  <br/> - UTC
- `status` (Attributes) Status information (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--status))

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

- `create` (Optional, String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
  consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (
  minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (Optional, String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
  consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (
  minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state
  before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (Optional, String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
  consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (
  minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (Optional, String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
  consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (
  minutes), "h" (hours).

<a id="nestedatt--status"></a>

### Nested Schema for `status`

- `histories` (Attributes List) List of past executions (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--status--histories))

<a id="nestedatt--status--histories"></a>

### Nested Schema for `status.histories`

- `description` (String) Description of the history
- `occurred_time` (String) Event occurrence time
- `state` (String) State value

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for
example:

```shell
$ terraform import kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_scheduled_scaling.example <cluster_name/node_pool_name/name>
```
