## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the network interface
- `security_groups` (Attributes Set) List of attached security groups (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--security_groups))
- `subnet_id` (String) ID of the connected subnet

### Optional

- `allowed_address_pairs` (Attributes Set) List of allowed IP addresses for packet transmission (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--allowed_address_pairs))
- `description` (String) Description of the network interface
- `private_ip` (String) Primary private IP address (IPv4 format)
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Time when the resource was created<br/> - ISO_8601 format<br/> - UTC standard
- `device_id` (String) ID of the resource attached to the network interface
- `device_owner` (String) Owner type of the resource attached to the interface (e.g., instance, router, etc.)
- `id` (String) Network interface ID
- `is_network_interface_security_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether security groups are enabled

### Nested Schema for `security_groups`

Required:

- `id` (String) Security group ID

Read-Only:

- `name` (String) Security group name

- `ip_address` (String) Allowed IP address

Read-Only:

- `mac_address` (String) Allowed MAC address


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
