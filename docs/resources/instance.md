# kakaocloud_instance (Resource)

The `kakaocloud_instance` resource allows you to create and manage virtual machine (VM) or bare metal (BM) instances in
KakaoCloud.  
You can specify compute configurations such as instance type, image, and attached volumes, as well as networking details
including subnets and security groups.  
This resource also provides access to detailed metadata and status information, enabling full lifecycle management of
instances for various workloads and environments.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Manage example instance
resource "kakaocloud_instance" "example" {
  name      = "example"
  flavor_id = "a5b8e9d2-4f0c-4bfc-a58b-b6c5e5f88e27"
  image_id  = "8cd12d35-fcd5-42af-b5ef-973b926a13e1"

  subnets = [
    {
      id = "93fd1234-6c18-4975-bcb7-818e3bde62c9"
    },
  ]

  volumes = [
    {
      size = 10
    },
  ]
}
```
