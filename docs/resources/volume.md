# kakaocloud_volume (Resource)

The `kakaocloud_volume` resource allows you to create and manage block storage volumes in KakaoCloud.
You can define volume size, type, encryption options, and source (image, snapshot, or existing volume).
This resource also provides metadata and lifecycle details, such as bootability, mount points, and attachment information, enabling reliable storage management for instances.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Manage example volume.
resource "kakaocloud_volume" "example" {
  name              = "example"
  description       = "terraform test"
  availability_zone = "kr-central-2-a"
  flavor_id         = "xxxxxx-yyyy-zzzz-81e8-836ebe461ba6"
  image_id          = "xxxxxx-yyyy-zzzz-81e8-836ebe461ba6"
  key_name          = "example-test"
  volumes = [
    { size = 30 },
  ]
  subnets = [
    {
      id = "xxxxxx-yyyy-zzzz-81e8-836ebe461ba6"
    }
  ]
  status = "active"
}
```

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Volume can be imported by specifying the uuid.
terraform import kakaocloud_volume.example xxxxxx-yyyy-zzzz-81e8-836ebe461ba6
```
