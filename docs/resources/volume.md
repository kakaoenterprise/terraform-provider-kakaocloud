# kakaocloud_volume (Resource)

The `kakaocloud_volume` resource allows you to create and manage block storage volumes in KakaoCloud.  
You can define volume size, type, encryption options, and source (image, snapshot, or existing volume).  
This resource also provides metadata and lifecycle details, such as bootability, mount points, and attachment
information, enabling reliable storage management for instances.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# kakaocloud_volume Terraform Resource Example

# Basic usage (kakaocloud_volume)
resource "kakaocloud_volume" "example" {
  name              = "example-volume"
  availability_zone = "kr-central-2-a"
  size              = 10
}

# Restore volume from snapshot (kakaocloud_volume)
resource "kakaocloud_volume" "example_restore" {
  name              = "example-volume-restore"
  availability_zone = "kr-central-2-a"
  volume_snapshot_id = kakaocloud_volume_snapshot.example.id
}
```

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

- `create` (Optional, String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
  consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (
  minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (Optional, String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
  consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (
  minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state
  before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (Optional, String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
  consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (
  minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (Optional, String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
  consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (
  minutes), "h" (hours).
