The `kakaocloud_instance_flavors` data source retrieves a list of available instance flavors in KakaoCloud.  
It supports filtering by attributes such as `name` and returns detailed specifications for each flavor, including CPU,
memory, disk type, availability zones, and hardware information.

Use this data source when you need to:

- Query available flavors dynamically instead of hardcoding flavor IDs.
- Filter instance flavors to select the right type for your workload (e.g., family, size, architecture).
- Validate hardware requirements such as vCPUs, memory, or disk type before creating compute instances.
