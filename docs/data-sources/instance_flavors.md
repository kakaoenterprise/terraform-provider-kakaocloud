  The kakaocloud_instance_flavors data source retrieves a list of available instance flavors in KakaoCloud.
  It supports filtering by attributes such as name and returns detailed specifications for each flavor, including CPU, memory, disk type, availability zones, and hardware information.
  Use this data source when you need to:
  Query available flavors dynamically instead of hardcoding flavor IDs.Filter instance flavors to select the right type for your workload (e.g., family, size, architecture).Validate hardware requirements such as vCPUs, memory, or disk type before creating compute instances.

# kakaocloud_instance_flavors (Data Source)

The `kakaocloud_instance_flavors` data source retrieves a list of available instance flavors in KakaoCloud.
It supports filtering by attributes such as `name` and returns detailed specifications for each flavor, including CPU, memory, disk type, availability zones, and hardware information.

Use this data source when you need to:
- Query available flavors dynamically instead of hardcoding flavor IDs.
- Filter instance flavors to select the right type for your workload (e.g., family, size, architecture).
- Validate hardware requirements such as vCPUs, memory, or disk type before creating compute instances.
