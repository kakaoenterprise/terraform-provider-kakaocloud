# kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_scheduled_scaling (Data Source)

The `kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_scheduled_scalings` data source retrieves information about scheduled scaling
configurations for node pools in a KakaoCloud Kubernetes Engine cluster.

This data source is useful when you need to:

- List all scheduled scaling rules for a specific cluster or node pool.
- Review scaling policies including target node counts, schedules, and execution types.
- Track operational details such as creation time, start time, and historical execution records.
- Dynamically reference scheduled scaling settings in Terraform configurations without hardcoding values.

# Get a specific scheduled scaling configuration by cluster, node pool, and rule name
data "kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_scheduled_scaling" "example" {
  cluster_name   = "<your-cluster-name>"
  node_pool_name = "<your-node-pool-name>"
  name           = "<your-scheduled-scaling-name>"
}

# Output the scheduled scaling information
output "scheduled_scaling_info" {
  description = "Information about the specified scheduled scaling rule"
  value       = data.kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_scheduled_scaling.example
}
```

## Argument Reference

- `cluster_name` (Required, String) Target cluster name
- `name` (Required, String) Scheduled autoscaling rule name

- `timeouts` (Optional, Attributes) Custom timeout settings. (See [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts).)

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

- `created_at` (String) Resource creation time <br/> - ISO_8601 format  <br/> - UTC
- `desired_nodes` (Number) Target number of nodes to maintain in the node pool when the schedule is executed
- `schedule` (String) Scheduled autoscaling execution cycle
- `schedule_type` (String) Type of the scheduled autoscaling cycle <br/>- Possible values: `Once` (run once), `Daily` (
  run every day), `Weekly` (run on specified weekdays)
- `start_time` (String) Reference time when scheduled autoscaling can actually run (ISO 8601, UTC)

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

- `read` (Optional, String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration)
  consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (
  minutes), "h" (hours).
