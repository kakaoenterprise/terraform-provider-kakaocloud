# kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_scheduled_scalings (Data Source)

The `kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_scheduled_scalings` data source retrieves information about scheduled scaling
configurations for node pools in a KakaoCloud Kubernetes Engine cluster.

This data source is useful when you need to:

- List all scheduled scaling rules for a specific cluster or node pool.
- Review scaling policies including target node counts, schedules, and execution types.
- Track operational details such as creation time, start time, and historical execution records.
- Dynamically reference scheduled scaling settings in Terraform configurations without hardcoding values.
