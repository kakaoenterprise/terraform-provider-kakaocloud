  The kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_upgradable_versions data source allows you to retrieve the list of Kubernetes versions that a given KakaoCloud Kubernetes Engine cluster can upgrade to.
  This data source is useful when you need to:
  Determine which Kubernetes versions are available for an in-place upgrade of your existing cluster.Validate that your cluster is running a version that supports upgrades within KakaoCloud’s compatibility rules.Dynamically reference upgradable version metadata in Terraform without hardcoding version values.Build upgrade automation workflows that align with KakaoCloud-supported upgrade paths.

# kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_upgradable_versions (Data Source)

The `kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_upgradable_versions` data source allows you to retrieve the list of Kubernetes
versions that a given KakaoCloud Kubernetes Engine cluster can upgrade to.

This data source is useful when you need to:

- Determine which Kubernetes versions are available for an in-place upgrade of your existing cluster.
- Validate that your cluster is running a version that supports upgrades within KakaoCloud’s compatibility rules.
- Dynamically reference upgradable version metadata in Terraform without hardcoding version values.
- Build upgrade automation workflows that align with KakaoCloud-supported upgrade paths.

By using this data source, you can ensure that your Terraform configuration reflects current KakaoCloud Kubernetes
Engine upgrade options and avoids invalid or unsupported version selections.

## Example Usage

```terraform

# Get a specific Kubernetes cluster by name
data "kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_upgradable_versions" "example" {
  cluster_name = "<your-cluster-name>"
  timeouts = {
    read = "30s"
  }
}

# Output the engine upgradable versions
output "upgradable_k8s_versions" {
  description = "List of Kubernetes versions that the cluster can upgrade to"
  value = {
    current_minor_version = data.kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_upgradable_versions.example.current.minor_version
    upgradable_versions   = data.kakaocloud_kubernetes_engine_upgradable_versions.example.upgradable[*].minor_version
  }
}
