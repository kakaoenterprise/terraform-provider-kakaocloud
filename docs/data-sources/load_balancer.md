# kakaocloud_load_balancer (Data Source)

The `kakaocloud_load_balancer` data source retrieves detailed information about a specific Load Balancer in
KakaoCloud.

associated listeners, and target group counts.

Use this data source when you need to:

- Reference an existing load balancer without hardcoding its attributes.
- Dynamically fetch listener or target group IDs for use in other Terraform resources.
- Validate load balancer status (e.g., operating or provisioning) before attaching new resources.

# Get a specific load balancer by ID
data "kakaocloud_load_balancer" "example" {
  id = "your-load-balancer-id-here" # Replace with your load balancer ID
}

# Output the fetched data
output "load_balancer_name" {
  value = data.kakaocloud_load_balancer.example
