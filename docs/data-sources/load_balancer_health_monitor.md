  The kakaocloud_load_balancer_health_monitor data source allows you to retrieve detailed information about a specific Load Balancer Health Monitor in KakaoCloud.
  This data source is useful when you need to:
  Reference an existing health monitor by its ID in your Terraform configuration.Check configuration values such as interval (delay), timeout, retries, or HTTP request settings.Verify the current operating or provisioning status of a health monitor.Retrieve associations between a health monitor and its target groups.
  By using this data source, you can ensure that your Terraform-managed infrastructure reflects the actual state and configuration of health monitors in KakaoCloud.
