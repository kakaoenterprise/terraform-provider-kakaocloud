# kakaocloud_network_interface (Data Source)

The `kakaocloud_network_interface` data source retrieves detailed information about a specific Network Interface in KakaoCloud.
It provides attributes such as private and public IP addresses, MAC address, associated security groups, allowed address pairs, and VPC/subnet information.

Use this data source when you need to:
- Reference an existing network interface in your Terraform configuration.
- Access networking details such as IPs, security groups, or VPC/subnet mappings without hardcoding values.
- Ensure dependent resources (e.g., instances, load balancers) are correctly attached to the intended network interface.

## Example Usage

```terraform

# Get a specific network interface by ID
data "kakaocloud_network_interface" "example" {
  id = "your-network-interface-id-here" # Replace with your network interface ID
}

# Output the network interface information
output "network_interface_example" {
  description = "Information about the example network interface"
  value       = kakaocloud_network_interface.example
}
```
