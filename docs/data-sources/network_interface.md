# kakaocloud_network_interface (Data Source)

The `kakaocloud_network_interface` data source retrieves detailed information about a specific Network Interface in
KakaoCloud.  
It provides attributes such as private and public IP addresses, MAC address, associated security groups, allowed address
pairs, and VPC/subnet information.

Use this data source when you need to:

- Reference an existing network interface in your Terraform configuration.
- Access networking details such as IPs, security groups, or VPC/subnet mappings without hardcoding values.
- Ensure dependent resources (e.g., instances, load balancers) are correctly attached to the intended network interface.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Copyright (c) HashiCorp, Inc.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: MPL-2.0

# Get a specific network interface by ID
data "kakaocloud_network_interface" "example" {
  id = "<your-network-interface-id>"
}

# Output network interface details
output "network_interface_details" {
  description = "Details of the specified network interface"
  value = {
    id          = data.kakaocloud_network_interface.example.id
    name        = data.kakaocloud_network_interface.example.name
    private_ip  = data.kakaocloud_network_interface.example.private_ip
    public_ip   = data.kakaocloud_network_interface.example.public_ip
    subnet_id   = data.kakaocloud_network_interface.example.subnet_id
    vpc_id      = data.kakaocloud_network_interface.example.vpc_id
    mac_address = data.kakaocloud_network_interface.example.mac_address
  }
}
```
