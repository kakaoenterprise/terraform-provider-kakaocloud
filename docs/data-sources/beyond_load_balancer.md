# kakaocloud_beyond_load_balancer (Data Source)

The `kakaocloud_beyond_load_balancer` resource represents a **High Availability (HA) load balancer group** in KakaoCloud.  
This resource is used to provision and manage Beyond Load Balancer services, ensuring traffic distribution and fault tolerance across multiple load balancers.  

You can use this resource to:  
- Create and manage HA groups with one or more load balancers.  
- Define load balancers to be attached to the HA group.  
- Associate the HA group with a VPC and its CIDR block.  
- Retrieve DNS names, availability zones, and operational status of the group.  
- Track provisioning and operating states for lifecycle management.  

By managing this resource in Terraform, you can automate deployment and scaling of resilient load balancing services in KakaoCloud.

## Example Usage

```terraform

# Get a specific beyond load balancer by ID
data "kakaocloud_beyond_load_balancer" "example" {
  id = "your-beyond-load-balancer-id-here" # Replace with your beyond load balancer ID
}

# Output the fetched data
output "beyond_load_balancer_name" {
  value = data.kakaocloud_beyond_load_balancer.example
}
```
