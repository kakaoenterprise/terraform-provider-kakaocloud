# kakaocloud_load_balancer_l7_policy_rules (Data Source)

The `kakaocloud_load_balancer_l7_policy_rules` data source retrieves a list of Layer 7 (L7) policy rules associated with a specific KakaoCloud Load Balancer L7 Policy.
It returns attributes such as rule type, comparison method, key/value conditions, inversion flag, and provisioning/operating status.

Use this data source when you need to:
- Query all rules for an L7 policy dynamically instead of hardcoding them.
- Filter rules by attributes such as type, compare type, or value to configure routing behavior.
- Validate that an L7 policy has the expected set of rules before applying changes to your Terraform configuration.
