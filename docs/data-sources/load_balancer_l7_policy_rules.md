# kakaocloud_load_balancer_l7_policy_rules (Data Source)

The `kakaocloud_load_balancer_l7_policy_rules` data source retrieves a list of Layer 7 (L7) policy rules associated with
a specific KakaoCloud Load Balancer L7 Policy.  
It returns attributes such as rule type, comparison method, key/value conditions, inversion flag, and
provisioning/operating status.

Use this data source when you need to:

- Query all rules for an L7 policy dynamically instead of hardcoding them.
- Filter rules by attributes such as type, compare type, or value to configure routing behavior.
- Validate that an L7 policy has the expected set of rules before applying changes to your Terraform configuration.

# List all L7 policy rules for a specific policy
data "kakaocloud_load_balancer_l7_policy_rules" "all" {
  id = "your-l7-policy-id-here" # Replace with your L7 policy ID
}

# List L7 policy rules with filters
data "kakaocloud_load_balancer_l7_policy_rules" "filtered" {
  id = "your-l7-policy-id-here" # Replace with your L7 policy ID
}

# Output the L7 policy rules list
output "all_l7_policy_rules" {
  description = "List of L7 policy rules"
  value       = data.kakaocloud_load_balancer_l7_policy_rules.all
}

# Output the filtered L7 policy rules list
