# kakaocloud_instance_flavor (Data Source)

The `kakaocloud_instance_flavor` data source retrieves detailed information about a specific instance flavor in
KakaoCloud.  
It returns attributes such as CPU, memory, disk type, availability zones, hyper-threading support, and other hardware
specifications.

Use this data source when you need to:

- Reference a specific flavor by its ID in your Terraform configuration.
- Dynamically obtain hardware details (e.g., vCPUs, memory, disk type) without hardcoding them.
- Validate that a flavor meets the requirements for your workloads before creating instances.

## Example Usage

```terraform

# SPDX-License-Identifier: MPL-2.0

# Get a specific instance flavor by ID
data "kakaocloud_instance_flavor" "example" {
  id = "<your-flavor-id>"
}

# Output instance flavor details
output "flavor_example" {
  description = "Information about the example instance flavor"
  value = {
    id                 = data.kakaocloud_instance_flavor.example.id
    name               = data.kakaocloud_instance_flavor.example.name
    vcpus              = data.kakaocloud_instance_flavor.example.vcpus
    memory_mb          = data.kakaocloud_instance_flavor.example.memory_mb
    disk_type          = data.kakaocloud_instance_flavor.example.disk_type
    instance_family    = data.kakaocloud_instance_flavor.example.instance_family
    manufacturer       = data.kakaocloud_instance_flavor.example.manufacturer
    is_burstable       = data.kakaocloud_instance_flavor.example.is_burstable
    is_hyper_threading = data.kakaocloud_instance_flavor.example.is_hyper_threading_supported
    availability_zones = data.kakaocloud_instance_flavor.example.availability_zone
  }
}
```
