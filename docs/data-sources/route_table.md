# kakaocloud_route_table (Data Source)

The `kakaocloud_route_table` data source retrieves detailed information about a specific Route Table in KakaoCloud.  
It provides attributes such as the associated VPC, route entries, subnet associations, provisioning status, and whether
the Route Table is the main table in the VPC.

Use this data source when you need to:

- Reference an existing Route Table in your Terraform configuration.
- Query routing details dynamically instead of hardcoding route information.

## Example Usage

# Get a specific route table by ID
data "kakaocloud_route_table" "example" {
  id = "your-route-table-id-here" # Replace with your route table ID
}

# Output the route table information
output "route_table_example" {
  description = "Information about the example route table"
  value       = kakaocloud_route_table.example
}
```
