# kakaocloud Provider

The kakaocloud provider is used to interact with [kakaocloud](https://www.kakaocloud.com/) services.
The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

!> **Warning** This provider is supported on **Terraform Version 1.11 or later**.

## Example Usage

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    kakaocloud = {
      source  = "kakaoenterprise/kakaocloud"
      version = "0.0.17"
    }
  }
}

provider "kakaocloud" {
  application_credential_id     = var.application_credential_id
  application_credential_secret = var.application_credential_secret
}
```
See the **Authentication** section below for details on configuring provider credentials.

## Authentication

The Kakaocloud provider supports two methods for authentication and credential management.

It checks for credentials in the following order, as detailed below:

- Static credentials
- Environment variables

### Static credentials

Static credentials can be specified directly in the Kakaocloud provider block using the `application_credential_id` and `application_credential_secret` arguments.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    kakaocloud = {
      source  = "kakaoenterprise/kakaocloud"
      version = "0.0.17"
    }
  }
}

provider "kakaocloud" {
  application_credential_id     = var.application_credential_id
  application_credential_secret = var.application_credential_secret
}
```

### Environment variables

Credentials can be supplied using the `KAKAOCLOUD_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_ID` and `KAKAOCLOUD_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_SECRET` environment variables, which correspond to the application credential ID and secret for Kakaocloud.

**Provider Example**

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    kakaocloud = {
      source  = "kakaoenterprise/kakaocloud"
      version = "0.0.17"
    }
  }
}

provider "kakaocloud" {}
```

**Environment Variables**

```shell
$ export KAKAOCLOUD_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_ID="application-credential-id"
$ export KAKAOCLOUD_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_SECRET="application-credential-secret"
$ terraform plan
```

-> **Note** Application credentials can be generated from the Kakaocloud console.
Please refer to the [kakaocloud documentation](https://docs.kakaocloud.com/start/console-guide/credentials) for detailed instructions on generating application credentials.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `application_credential_id` (String, Sensitive) Application credential ID for Kakaocloud authentication
- `application_credential_secret` (String, Sensitive) Application credential secret for Kakaocloud authentication
